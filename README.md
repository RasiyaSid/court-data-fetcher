# court-data-fetcher
Mini dashboard to retrieve court case details from eCourts portal

##  Overview
This project is a Flask + Selenium-based web application designed to fetch case details from the **Thrissur District Court Orders Search** portal.  
The user provides case details via an HTML form, and the system scrapes the court website to retrieve and display the information.

##  Features Implemented
- HTML form for user input (`case_type`, `case_number`, `case_year`)
- Flask backend to handle requests and responses
- Selenium-based automation to:
  - Open the Thrissur District Court search page
  - Fill in form details automatically
  - Retrieve case details from the results page
- Result display on a dedicated HTML page

##  Current Limitations
- Extraction of data from the court page is not implemented in the current version.
- PDF extraction of court orders is also not implemented.
- The application currently focuses on opening the court search page and automating form submission.
